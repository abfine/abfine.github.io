We decided to homeschool all our kids.
<br>
After the massacre happened we didn't want to take anymore chances.
<br>
We brought them home and got all the books we needed off the internet 
<br>
and we ordered calculators and rulers and compasses off Amazon.
<br>
We put a metal table in the bonus room and moved the Macintosh in there. 
<br>
We bought a new mouse for the Macintosh.
<br>
We started with <i>Bridge to Terabithia</i> and struggled some with <i>The Red Pony</i> before discovering it might be a liberal story. 
<br>
We all cried at the end of <i>Where the Red Fern Grows</i> and then as an encore read <i>Shiloh</i> to boost reading morale even though we all knew it was minor dog literature.
<br>
<br>
We made it through several units of trigonometry and the kids were safe and the carpet in the bonus room looked like a mammal's circulatory system had been imprinted in it by the wheels of the rolling chairs we used for learning together. 
<br>
We used the likeness of the circulatory system in the carpet as a learning example and finessed some tricky anatomical lessons.
<br>
Over Easter break we dyed eggs and the smell of vinegar drifted up to the bonus room and got on the Macintosh. 
<br>
A boy from youth group gave us a Yoda mousepad and the mousepad carried the bad smell of the youth group couches into the bonus room, and there couch and vinegar odors mixed and we all thought of these smells while we did the stoichiometry. 
<br>
The chemical equations were beyond us and we skipped chemistry opting instead to wait for summer.
<br>
<br>
Summer came and we had made it through the year with no massacres and moreover we had earned an implicit leadership role in the Homeschool Flag Football League. 
<br>
<br>
And there in the semifinals little Michael Hudson had been kneed in the face by one of our own when that one attempted to jump over the line of scrimmage the way Emmitt Smith always does in the Dallas Cowboys movie we watch in the bonus room. 
<br>
He tucks the ball in tight under his left arm and you can see his thighs shaking in slow motion when he jumps up into the air in front of Troy Aikman, defensive linemen all around and under him as he soars over the heads of those strong men who fall like great buildings detonated slowly from top to bottom and from within, 
<br>
the dust rising about them as Emmitt Smith lands in a forward roll in the endzone and as we all say a silent prayer about all the massacres, leaving our eyes open to pray in secret.
