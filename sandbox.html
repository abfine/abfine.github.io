<h1> The Sandbox </h1>
<h3> by Alex B. Fine </h3>

<br>
<br>
<font face="courier">


There was a small sandbox, 8 feet by 8 feet, on the other side of the driveway, across from the sliding-glass door.

<br>
<br>


The box was made of untreated two-by-fours and they had bent slightly over the years and the sand leaked through where the two-by-fours were joined by nails and the sand mixed with the red dirt.
<br>
<br>

In the sandbox were certain objects belonging to the boy:
<br>
<br>

Several GI Joes.  Other lesser Guys.  A small model airplane with a broken fuselage.   Toy tanks of a different make altogether.
<br>
<br>

The sandbox was a staging ground for important battles:
<br>
<br>

The enemy’s attacking from across the river!
<br>
<br>

Send out the F-16s!
<br>
<br>

Get the bazooka launchers!
<br>
<br>

Deploy the anti-aircraft cannons!
<br>
<br>

The boy went to church every Sunday and learned about heaven and hell and how the Lord sees all your thoughts…
<br>
<br>

And how the Lord answers prayers.
<br>
<br>

And how you can talk to the lord and communicate with Him and know His will.
<br>
<br>

And the boy longed to speak to the lord and to be forgiven for his many sins.
<br>
<br>

He wanted the lord to forgive him for making the GI Joes use bad words
<br>
<br>

He wanted the lord to forgive him for wanting too many new toys.
<br>
<br>

The boy got taller and so the men and their arms grew further away and the separation between the boy’s mind and the many wars of the sandbox grew firmer.
<br>
<br>

GI Joes were left neglected in the sand.
<br>
<br>

Rain came in afternoon thunderstorms and drowned the GI Joes and rusted their small joints and the GI Joes’ limbs became brittle.
<br>
<br>

Rain came and rainwater forced earthworms out of the soil and into the sandbox to mingle with GI Joes and it looked gross when the GI Joes and the worms touched each other.
<br>
<br>

Certain puppies became available on a nearby farm and the boy asked for one.  The boy brought the puppy home and put her in a small house, with a chain to keep her in place.
<br>
<br>

The boy put the puppy in the sandbox and the two-by-fours kept her in place. 
<br>
<br>

The boy loved the puppy and stroked its ears and stomach and did not become angry when the puppy nipped at his toes and fingers.
<br>
<br>

The puppy grew and became too large for the sandbox and the boy wanted her location to remain predictable so she was chained to a doghouse.
<br>
<br>

One day he closed his eyes close to the sandbox and the Lord told him that dogs shouldn’t be tied to dog houses or any piece of furniture or other types of wood.  
<br>
<br>

“Dogs need exercise or they become depressed and mad and that’s why the puppy barks too much”, the Lord explained.  “The puppy loves you and she wants to be close to you always”.  The Lord explained the puppy’s needs gracefully and the boy listened with his brow furrowed.
<br>
<br>

After the Lord finished speaking the boy wiped the tears of shame away with his t-shirt and went inside and found a phone book.  
<br>
<br>

In the phone book he found the name of a nice lady and he called her on the phone.
<br>
<br>

She answered the phone and he explained to her that his puppy was special but that he’d also been told certain things by the Lord.
<br>
<br>

She said “maybe now is not the right time in your life to be this puppy’s main caretaker” but you could tell she smiled kindly as she spoke.
<br>
<br>

The boy choked on his tears and said she was right, that the Lord had practically said the same thing, and she must go to a similar church as him and his mom.
<br>
<br>

The nice lady laughed and made the boy feel good and said he was very brave to just use the phonebook like that.  
<br>
<br>

The lady drove her Oldsmobile to the boy’s house and was careful not to run over the sandbox, even though it was hard to see sometimes.  
<br>
<br>

She hugged the boy and while they hugged the boy felt so close to the nice lady.
<br>
<br>

And he hadn’t felt so close to another thing since the GI Joes went to war and he felt like he could just make her talk and make her win battles as he’d done with so many GI Joes.
<br>
<br>

He smelled her perfume and her hair and heard her necklaces jangle together and he knew his puppy would be safe forever.  
<br>
<br>

She put the puppy in a big blanket and the puppy fell asleep in her arms.
<br>
<br>

She drove away with the puppy still asleep on her shoulder and the boy waved goodbye to the nice lady as she drove away in her Oldsmobile
<br>
<br>

He waved goodbye standing barefoot in the driveway, or right next to it actually, because the pavement was very hot.
