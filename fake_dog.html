<h1> A Fake Dog </h1>

<br>
<br>
<font face="courier">

No one could prove he was a dog.  The people at the shelter insisted he was one but they have ulterior motives.  I took a blood sample once we got home but the genetic testing was surprisingly inconclusive and plus it was expensive.  All I could establish from the cheek swabs was that he was not a Doberman.  His gait did not seem to me like that of a dog, belonging more probably to some ungulate or other or to a primate I hadn't yet learned about.  

<br>
<br>

Our daughters loved him and played fetch with him in the yard but, watching through the living room window, I could tell he wasn't technically a dog.  His tail wasn't vestigial enough and it trailed too far behind him and too low to the ground and there was something disturbing about how deliberately he sniffed the ground.

<br>
<br>

On Christmas morning my wife presented him with a bag of treats from the pet store and he picked through the bag pulling out the toys--a knotted length of rope dyed whimsical green, a ball with battery-powered lights that became more intensely illuminated the faster it rolled.  He pulled them out one at a time and laid them on the rug neatly, as if in prayer or in preparation for a long vacation.  Our youngest daughter laughed at this, and she stroked his velveteen ears and while she did that my wife, sitting on the floor beside the rocking chair where I always sat on Christmas morning while we all opened presents, gently rested her head on my knee, as if this thing was the final piece of a foundation she'd spent years building and seeing how good it was could finally rest.  And we made love later that morning for the first time in weeks as our daughters played their new games downstairs and as he watched the reflection of our writhing bodies in the mirror from where he lay at the foot of the bed.

<br>
<br>

The signs accumulated for me over many more weeks and at last I decided I had no choice when I found him in the garbage, scurrying between the trash cans and the house like some rare and giant African rodent come to our subdivision.  I got my pistol from the toolbox in the garage but I couldn't bring myself to shoot him even though I could just hear my dad telling me to shoot him and to quit jeopardizing my family's safety.  I looked for poisons in the garage I could give him but I didn't know which ones would be humane and so I decided I would risk a few more days living with him and wait.

<br>
<br>

Finally one weekend our daughters went to a bible camp in the mountains.  My wife planned to drop them off at camp and then spend the weekend nearby in Asheville with her sister.  We all hugged goodbye and I waved to them as my wife pulled the Jeep Grand Cherokee past the driveway from where it was parked out front and turned around in the cul de sac and drove down the street and pulled out onto the highway.

<br>
<br>

Once they were gone I pulled my Kia into the garage and put towels under the doors.  I started the ignition and let it run a while.  I fried a pack of bacon in a skillet as he watched me silently, his mouth watering slightly.  Since I had the bacon he followed me out into the garage.  I put it down on his bed and went back inside and closed the door.  I cleaned the fying pan and as I did my hands were shaking.  I put on my headphones and walked out the front door and walked quickly away from the house down the street.  I wept but I knew we'd been lied to about him being a dog and I knew my dad would shake his head calmly and say I'd done the only thing TO do.  I walked faster and wondered how far I could walk from the house without having to walk on the highway and I walked without knowing what to do next.
