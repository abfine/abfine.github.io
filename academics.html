<h2> Research overview </h2>

My research seeks to understand how humans are able to think and act in the face of variability in the environment. Cognition and perception involve making inferences about the world on the basis of noisy and variable sensory data.  A growing body of work suggests that humans overcome variability by <i>adapting</i> to the statistics of novel environments.  Understanding adaptation has been the focus of a great deal of research in perception and motor planning.  In my research, I examine adaptation in human language processing as a way to ask fundamental questions about what it means to know and use language, and about adaptation and learning broadly construed.  <br>


<br> Human language is highly variable in the sense that talkers and authors use different sounds, words, and syntactic constructions depending on facts about the talker (e.g., age, geographic origin) as well as the conversational setting (e.g., whether we are speaking informally at a bar or formally in an academic job interview).  Variability in human language is widely documented; however, the way in which humans are able to understand language in spite of this variability has been studied relatively little, especially in higher-level language processing (e.g., processing syntactic and semantic information).  In my research, I ask how humans understand spoken and written language with such apparent ease despite the variability, noise, and ambiguity that pervade the linguistic signal, focusing on syntactic processing.


<h2> Biography </h2>

I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a B.A. in Linguistics in 2006.  Not convinced that I had acquired enough experience poking humans with cold instruments, I got a job as a research technician for two years in <a href="http://www.bu.edu/psych/faculty/htagerf/">Helen Tager-Flusberg's</a> lab at Boston University. After that I spent five years doing a joint-PhD in Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Linguistics at the University of Rochester, where I worked primarily with <a href="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/fjaeger/">Florian Jaeger</a>, as well as with <a href="http://www.ling.rochester.edu/people/faculty/runner_jeff/index.html">Jeff Runner</a>. </br>

<br>After graduating from Rochester, I moved to Champaign, IL, where I did a post-doc in the Psychology Department at the University of Illinois, working with Sarah Brown-Schmidt, Gary Dell, and Duane Watson. </br>

 <br> From the Fall of 2014 through the Summer of 2015, I was a <a href="http://ldft.huji.ac.il">Lady Davis Fellow</a> at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, working with <a href="http://psychology.huji.ac.il/en/?cmd=Faculty.113&act=read&id=42">Ram Frost</a> in the <a href=http://psychology.huji.ac.il/en/">Department of Psychology</a>. </br>
