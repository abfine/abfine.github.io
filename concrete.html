<h1> A concrete story </h1>
<h3> by Alex B. Fine </h3>

I was waiting in the living room for my brother to drive me to my first swimming lesson and my dad walked into the room and his beard was terrifying.

<br>
<br>

He'd set his beard into four thick braids and lit a slow-burning fuse inside each braid.

<br>
<br>

He picked me up and held me to his chest and the sulfurous fumes felt poisonous to me.

<br>
<br>

He described how some Chinese laborers working on a large dam would lose their footing and fall into the wet concrete.

<br>
<br>

Because of the volume of concrete and the incredible rate at which it was poured, there was not much anybody could do and so the laborers who fell in were left to drown and die.

<br>
<br>

The wet concrete filled their lungs and alveoli and all the other cavities in their bodies and then the concrete would dry and there their bodies would remain forever, suspended in the concrete.

<br>
<br>

But water is different, my dad explained.  

<br>
<br>

It fills your lungs and all your other holes like wet concrete but it moves constantly, one water molecule leaving your body as another one enters it.

<br>
<br>

He held me tight and he said there are whole fields of study devoted to understanding how your lungs remain filled with water while the identity of the specific molecules in your lungs and other cavities constantly change over time.

<br>
<br>

He said this is called the ship of Theseus and it's the reason you can never idenfity your killer, unless you get lucky like one of the Chinese laborers, who stay trapped in the same concrete molecules forever.
